Grails Inviter Plugin
=====================

The grails inviter plugin allows you to quickly import contacts from various social networks and mail providers into your application. 

It is similar in functionality to the following social sharing plugins:
* [OpenInviter](http://openinviter.com/) - PHP 
* [Plaxo Social Widget](http://www.plaxo.com/api/widget) - Web  
* [Jainrain Engage Social Sharing](http://www.janrain.com/products/engage/social-sharing) - Web 

The main difference of this plugin is that it uses Groovy / Grails and can be deeply integrated quickly and easily to any grails site. When possible, the plugin uses each platform's authentication to comply with the policies set by each provider ( rather than scrapping address book information ). 

Under the hood, the plugin uses the excellent [Scribe oAuth library](https://github.com/fernandezpablo85/scribe-java) by Pablo Fernandez.

The plugin currently supports the following networks
* Facebook
* Google
* Yahoo
* Twitter
* LinkedIn
* Windows Live
* CSV Import
